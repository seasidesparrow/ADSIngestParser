<description descriptionType="Abstract">The University of Wyoming (UW) King Air atmospheric boundary layer measurement missions were flown in 1987 during IFCs 3 and 4. This Raw Boundary Layer Fluxes data set contains parameters that describe the environment in which the flux data were collected and the flux data itself. The fluctuations in all variables were calculated with three different methods (the arithmetic means removed, the linear trends removed, or filtered with a high-pass recursive filter) prior to the eddy correlation calculations. This data set contains the data with the arithmetic means removed (i.e., RAW). All the flux measurements were obtained with the eddy-correlation method, wherein the aircraft is equipped with an inertial platform, accelerometers, and a gust probe for measurement of earth-relative gusts in the x, y, and z directions. Gusts in these dimensions are then correlated with each other for momentum fluxes and with fluctuations in other variables to obtain the various scalar fluxes, such as temperature (for sensible heat flux) and water vapor mixing ratio (for latent heat flux). The summary of data calculated from each aircraft pass includes various statistics, correlations, and fluxes calculated after the time series for each variable with the arithmetic means removed.  </description>
