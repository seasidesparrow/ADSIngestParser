<p>Since 2015, the Ecomodernist Manifesto has inspired efforts to shape a better future for people and the rest of life in the Anthropocene. At the same time, misconceptions and misunderstandings have arisen about what ecomodernism stands for. As three authors of the Manifesto, we offer this clarifying perspective.</p>
<sec id="section1-20530196231221495">
<title>Environmental challenges demand action</title>
<p>Earth continues to warm because of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. Biodiversity losses are increasing, and environmental pollution is harming ecosystems and human societies alike. Concerted public policy efforts and long-term investments are needed to end fossil fuel emissions, to conserve and restore habitats and end rapid extinctions, and to reduce harmful pollution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-20530196231221495">
<title>Human development has enormous benefits</title>
<p>Human development has enabled broad and unprecedented improvements in the human condition, with famine virtually abolished, rapid reductions in maternal and infant mortality, and general improvements in basic living conditions. Science, medicine, and technological developments have been critical to these improvements and should be celebrated, promoted, and defended.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-20530196231221495">
<title>Technologies are tools</title>
<p>All realistic options to shape a better future for people and planet, including the clean energy transition, making space for nature, and reducing and ending pollution, depend on embracing technological advances. Nevertheless, even technological innovations that open up new opportunities for environmental and social benefits can create new problems—trade-offs—which then need to be addressed in turn.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-20530196231221495">
<title>Economic growth is not a panacea</title>
<p>Economic growth has been associated with many desirable outcomes for people and many negative environmental impacts. But economic growth and environmental protection need not be incompatible, and continuing economic growth is essential in low-income countries. A mix of public and private sector actions are critical to shaping a better future for people and planet, including a strong role for governments and the state, both in regulating pollution and fostering technological innovation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-20530196231221495">
<title>Power to the people</title>
<p>We believe fundamentally that all human life is of equal value, that human rights are universal, and that a better world demands equal opportunity for all. We reject any form of dictatorship and support free and fair elections, press freedoms, and all forms of participatory politics and governance as fundamental human rights that extend beyond formal elections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-20530196231221495">
<title>In Summary</title>
<p>Ecomodernism is a work in progress and a broad church. We remain convinced that its core vision points the way forward. Environmental limits do not define the possibilities for a better future for life on Earth. Human aspirations and the fate of the planet need not conflict. A better future for both is achievable when societies work together to develop, invest in, and build new capabilities, from clean energy and green cities to more productive and environmentally sound food systems. We welcome debate and further discussion on these suggestions and on the original manifesto.</p>
